<p>Humans are uniquely adept at utilizing systems of symbolic communication such as language and art for
self-expression, the exchange of ideas, and organization. Humans create complex social structures composed of
many cooperating and competing groups, from families and kinship networks to states. Social interactions
between humans have established an extremely wide variety of values, social norms, and rituals, which together
form the basis of human society. Humans are noted for their desire to understand and influence their
environment, seeking to explain and manipulate phenomena through science, philosophy, mythology, and religion.</p>
