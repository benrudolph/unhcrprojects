Humans (variously Homo sapiens and Homo sapiens sapiens) are primates of the family Hominidae, and the only
extant species of the genus Homo.[2][3] Humans are distinguished from other animals by a relatively larger
brain with a particularly well developed neocortex, prefrontal cortex and temporal lobes; enabling high levels
of abstract reasoning, language, introspection, problem solving, culture through social learning, and other
important mental capabilities which, combined with bipedal locomotion that frees the hands for manipulating
objects, has allowed far greater use of tools than any other species. Humans are the only extant species known
to build fires and cook their food, as well as the only known species to clothe themselves and create and use
numerous other technologies and arts. The scientific study of humans is the discipline of anthropology.
