Homo sapiens originated in Africa, where it reached anatomical modernity about 200,000 years ago and began to
exhibit full behavioral modernity around 50,000 years ago.[4] The human lineage diverged from the last common
ancestor with its closest living relative, the chimpanzee, some five million years ago, evolving into the
Australopithecines and eventually the genus Homo.[5] The first Homo species to move out of Africa was Homo
erectus, the African variety of which, together with Homo heidelbergensis, is considered to be the immediate
ancestor of modern humans.[6][7] Homo sapiens proceeded to colonize the continents, arriving in Eurasia
125,000â€“60,000 years ago,[8][9] Australia around 40,000 years ago, the Americas around 15,000 years ago, and
remote islands such as Hawaii, Easter Island, Madagascar, and New Zealand between the years AD 300 and
1280.
